# Ballast contracts

Six Soroban contracts (Rust) plus `common`, a shared library of access-control, timelock, pause,
price, risk, and margin logic used across all of them. See `../PRD.md` §6.2 and §8 for the design
and interface each one implements, and each crate's own module doc comment for what's simplified
in this skeleton pass.

| Crate | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `common` | Shared roles/timelock/pause/price/risk/margin logic — not itself a deployable contract |
| `registry` | Asset configs, haircut parameters, timelocked param changes |
| `price-guard` | Median/band/staleness/halt price logic (PRD §6.4) |
| `pledge-vault` | Escrow/lien collateral positions |
| `credit-line` | Credit lines, draws, repayments, the margin state machine |
| `exit-desk` | RWA → USDC instant exit |
| `repo-dvp` | Bilateral repo, atomic DvP |

## Pause scopes

`ballast-common::pause::PauseScope` has four targeted scopes plus an `All` override that `is_paused`
applies to every scope. This is the complete map of what each scope gates, taken from the
`pause::require_not_paused` call sites:

| Scope | Contract | Entry point | Gated |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Pledges` | `pledge-vault` | `pledge` | yes |
| `Draws` | `credit-line` | `draw` | yes |
| `Exits` | `exit-desk` | `exit` | yes |
| `Repos` | `repo-dvp` | `accept_and_settle` | yes |
| `All` | n/a | none; overrides every scope above | n/a |

### Intentionally ungated

These move no new risk, so they stay callable while a scope (or `All`) is paused. PRD §8
invariant 5 ("pausing cannot move funds") requires it.

| Contract | Entry point | Why it is not gated |
|---|---|---|
| `credit-line` | `repay` | Repayment must always work. |
| `credit-line` | `liquidate`, `close_liquidated` | Liquidation must run while paused, or a bad line can never be cleared. |
| `credit-line` | `withdraw_undrawn`, `withdraw_interest` | The lender taking its own capital back out only lowers exposure. |
| `pledge-vault` | `release` | The borrower returning collateral, checked to leave the line healthy. |
| `pledge-vault` | `liquidate` | The keeper seizing collateral must work while paused. |
| `repo-dvp` | `unwind` | Leg 2 at or after maturity closes the trade and returns collateral. |
| `repo-dvp` | `top_up` | Adds collateral; a borrower must be able to cure a call while paused. |
| `repo-dvp` | `call_margin`, `default_close` | Keeper evaluation and enforcement must keep running. |
| `exit-desk` | `withdraw` | The desk withdrawing its own balance, not a holder's funds. |

Read-only entry points (`quote`, `ltv`, `margin_view` and the other getters) are ungated as well.

### Known gaps

- `repo-dvp::propose` is not gated, although `require_not_paused`'s doc comment treats a new repo as
  new risk. Tracked in #846.
- The gating contracts read pause flags from their own storage and only `Registry::pause` writes a
  flag, so a flag cannot currently be set on the contract that checks it. Tracked in #30 and #32.

## Building

`soroban-sdk` 28.x's build script refuses a plain `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`
and requires the Stellar CLI's wrapper instead. From inside a contract's own directory:

```
stellar contract build
```

This produces `../target/wasm32v1-none/release/<crate>.wasm`. `cargo test -p <crate>` (run from
`contracts/`, on the host target) works normally for unit tests and does not need `stellar-cli`.

## Deploying to testnet

See `scripts/README.md`'s "Testnet end-to-end run" section for how to build, deploy, and wire up
all six contracts against the public Stellar testnet.

## `price-guard`'s `publish_nav` — issuer-signature verification (breaking ABI change)

`PriceGuard.publish_nav` now takes an additional `asset_code: Bytes` argument (the asset's ticker,
e.g. `"SPIKO"`, as raw UTF-8 bytes — see the crate's module doc comment) and, when the contract's
`require_nav_signature` flag is `true` (the default), verifies `sig` against the asset's registered
issuer key (`configure_issuer_key`, admin-only) over the canonical message
`"{asset_code}:{ts}:{value}"`, via `env.crypto().ed25519_verify(...)`.

This was a breaking change to `publish_nav`'s call signature. Both `scripts/deploy.sh` and
`scripts/e2e-smoke.sh` have since been updated for it (verified against a real testnet deployment
— see `TESTNET_DEPLOYMENT.md`):

- `scripts/deploy.sh` calls `configure_signature_requirement --admin ... --required false` right
  after `configure_asset` for `price-guard`, since the smoke-test deploy registers no real issuer
  key for its test `RWA1` asset.
- `scripts/e2e-smoke.sh`'s `publish_nav` call now passes `--asset_code` (the hex-encoded UTF-8
  bytes of `"RWA1"`) alongside the existing `ZERO_SIG` placeholder.

`require_nav_signature` defaults to `true` on a fresh deploy (see the crate's module doc comment on
why this flag exists — it's a local-testing/bring-up affordance, not a security control) — a real
testnet/mainnet deploy should call `configure_issuer_key` for every asset before flipping it on if
it was ever turned off, and should leave it at its default `true` otherwise.
